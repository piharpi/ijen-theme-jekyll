Hello! I'm Jigyasu, a sophomore at the [National Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Technology_(India)) Agartala pursuing my undergrad in electronics and instrumentation engineering.
I'm interested in artificial intelligence, computer graphics, and human-computer interaction (HCI).

Currently, I am collaborating with [Dr. Amitava Das](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HYpfhaEAAAAJ&hl=en) at the [AI Institute, University of South Carolina](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/engineering_and_computing/research/research_centers_and_institutes/artificial_intelligence_institute/index.php), where I am researching watermarking methods for AI-generated content.

I also contribute to [sktime](https://www.sktime.net/) as a mentee.
